# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Overview of Project
Performing analysis on the kickstarter sheet to uncover trends by using different methods and formulas to understand in a more clear and visual sense. Using different formulas allows us to filter out data we want to extract in turn give us specific data to create the charts "Outcomes Based on Launch Date Chart" and "Outcomes Based on Goals Chart"
## Purpose
The objective of this project was to help Louise and ourselves to visualize how different campaigns compared in the outcomes based on launch dataes and outcomes based on goals in break the data that was given. 
## Analysis and Challenges
To start off, I initially started with the Kickstarter data sheet and filtered very specific data with different categories. We began filtering out the chart to show only a specific parent category, "theatre". This is an very important first step into moving foward creating new data. We collected the outcomes first to have the successful, failed, and canceled data. Second we collected the goal data of every play by using particular ranges in order to further more organize our data of outcomes based on goals. With all this data collected we were able to create the two line charts from the pivot tables created. The challenges I faced and found the most difficult was just memorizing speicifc formulas in order to best transfer data, but later understood what formula best suited for each column & row cell point.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Through the analysis on the "Outcomes Based on Launch Date" we can see visually on the count of outcomes on left side. On the bottom of the graph we see a month by month interval from January to December. Lastly on the right of the graph we have a key showing what each color represents, blue representing successful, red representing failed, and yellow representing canceled.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
In second chart "Outcomes Based on Goals" we can oberserve the line chart having similar points but utilizing different data. On the left chart it displays the percentage rate. On the bottom of the chart it displays goals in different ranges. Lastly the key on the very bottom showering light blue representing Percentage Successful, yellow representing Percentage failed, and dark blue representing Percentage Canceled to which there is zero percent.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Some challenges I encountered for the first graph "Outcomes Based on Launch Date" was initially deciding which filter, categories, and sub categories I needed to collect and make the graph. Eventually I understood what was neccessary through trial and error and what looked most presentable and understandable for the analysis. Other challenge I faced for the second data sheet was formating the percentage success and failed rate to make the cells into percentages instead of general numbers. 
## Results
By observing our "Theatre Outcomes Based on Launch Date" line chart we can see a high success rate rising from March and peaking at May, then gradually falling from there. On the opposing data, observing failed we can see that around October most theatres failed around then but overall the amount of failed theatre is consistent and has no big drops or peaks. Also to add, around October there was no canceled theatres. In second chart "Outcomes Based on Goals" we can visually see that based on the goals, the percentage of successful and failed projects outcome changes. On oberservation we can see that with the number of successful projects, is a lot higher with more projects and lower goals. Vice versa, with the number of failed projects, it is somewhat higher with less projects, with higher goals. We can conclude that there is a pattern that if the goals are set lower the success rate will be higher, and if the goals are set higher the failed rate will be higher. As far as limitations for the present line graphs, we couldn't pin point exact data like a box and whisker plot would. As this graph would allow a more effective way to show the average and median of the data set given.
